This utility will help you work with segmented WAV files from DiffSinger!  
Specifically, it is designed to reformat .wav files after batch cleaning from noise, echo, etc., back to the original DiffSinger format.  
It converts everything to mono 16-bit and can remove extra suffixes after processing in third-party software, and optionally applies a smooth fade-in/fade-out to your audio!  
All modified files are saved to the 'converted' folder.  
Supports English, Russian, French, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Chinese and Japanese interface languages.
